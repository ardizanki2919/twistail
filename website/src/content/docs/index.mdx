Twistail is a thoughtfully crafted component library designed for modern React applications.
Built on the foundation of Radix UI Primitives, Tailwind CSS v4, Tailwind Variants, and TypeScript,
it offers a comprehensive suite of accessible, customizable, and type-safe components to
streamline your development process.

## Core Principles

- **Tailwind Variants** - Leveraging the power of Tailwind Variants for advanced styling control
- **Accessibility First** - Every component adheres to WCAG guidelines and WAI-ARIA patterns
- **Developer Experience** - Intuitive APIs with comprehensive TypeScript definitions
- **Design Flexibility** - Easily adapt components to match your unique design system
- **Separation of Concerns** - CSS files are separated from component logic for improved maintainability and readability

## Why Twistail?

Twistail stands out from other component libraries like shadcn/ui by fully embracing
[**Tailwind Variants**](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/) - a powerful utility that
combines Tailwind's flexibility with a first-class variant API. This key difference provides:

- **Superior Variant Management** - Create complex component states with a clean, declarative API
- **Responsive Variants** - Easily define different styles across breakpoints
- **Slot-based Styling** - Apply styles to specific parts of components with precision
- **Conflict Resolution** - Automatic handling of conflicting Tailwind classes
- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript integration for autocomplete and error prevention

## Design Philosophy

Twistail follows a component architecture that maximizes the benefits of Tailwind Variants while
separating styling from logic. This approach offers:

- **Improved Readability** - Cleaner component files with variant definitions clearly separated
- **Enhanced Maintainability** - Style variants can be modified without affecting component logic
- **Better Collaboration** - Designers can work on style variants while developers focus on functionality
- **Simplified Theming** - Create theme variants with minimal code duplication
- **Consistent API** - Uniform pattern for handling component variations across the library

This architecture creates a more sustainable and flexible codebase that scales with your project's complexity.

## FAQs

<Accordions type='single'>
  <Accordion title="Is Twistail open source?">
    Twistail is licensed under a dual license: [Apache License 2.0](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2-0-apache-2-0)
    and [MIT license](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license). This means you
    can choose either license based on your project's needs. The dual licensing
    provides flexibility for both commercial and open-source projects. Copyrights
    in the project are retained by their contributors. For more details,
    you can refer to the [LICENSE-APACHE](https://github.com/riipandi/twistail/blob/main/LICENSE-APACHE)
    and [LICENSE-MIT](https://github.com/riipandi/twistail/blob/main/LICENSE-MIT) files in the repository.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does Twistail differ from shadcn/ui?">
    The key difference is our integration of Tailwind Variants. While `shadcn/ui`
    uses [Class Variance Authority](https://cva.style/docs), Twistail leverages
    Tailwind Variants to provide a more powerful, type-safe API for component styling.
    This allows for more complex variant combinations, better handling of responsive
    styles, and cleaner component code. Additionally, our separation of styling
    from component logic creates a more maintainable architecture.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What benefits does Tailwind Variants provide?">
    Tailwind Variants enhances the Tailwind experience by providing a first-class variant API.
    This means you can define component variants (like size, color, state) in a structured
    way with TypeScript support. It efficiently handles class merging, prevents style
    conflicts, and enables slot-based styling for complex components. The result is
    cleaner code, better developer experience, and more maintainable styling.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does Twistail separate CSS from component files?">
    Separating CSS from component logic improves maintainability and readability of
    the codebase. This approach makes it easier to update styles without touching
    component logic, simplifies debugging of styling issues, and creates a cleaner
    development experience. When combined with Tailwind Variants, this separation
    becomes even more powerful, allowing for sophisticated styling patterns without
    cluttering component files.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Twistail with my existing Tailwind setup?">
    Yes! Twistail is designed to work seamlessly with existing Tailwind CSS projects.
    Our components use Tailwind Variants which is compatible with standard Tailwind
    configurations. You can gradually adopt Twistail components alongside your
    existing UI elements and even leverage Tailwind Variants for your custom components.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Twistail with Tailwind CSS v3?">
    Twistail is primarily designed and optimized for Tailwind CSS v4. While it can be used with
    Tailwind CSS v3, some adjustments may be necessary, and you might encounter styling issues
    due to breaking changes introduced in Tailwind CSS v4. For the best experience and to avoid
    potential styling problems, we recommend using Twistail with Tailwind CSS v4. If you're using
    Tailwind CSS v3, be prepared to make some adaptations to ensure proper component rendering.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is Twistail suitable for production applications?">
    Absolutely. Twistail is built with production use cases in mind. Our components
    are thoroughly tested for accessibility, performance, and cross-browser compatibility.
    Even better, Twistail components are designed to be highly customizable. The use of Tailwind Variants
    also ensures consistent styling behavior across different environments and browsers.

## Acknowledgements

Twistail is a thoughtful blend of design philosophies from two exceptional UI libraries:

- **[Tremor](https://tremor.so/)**: Many of Twistail's foundational components draw heavy inspiration from Tremor's well-crafted designs. We've reimagined these components with our own architectural approach while respecting Tremor's excellent work.

- **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)**: Twistail incorporates design patterns and component structures from shadcn/ui, adapting them to fit seamlessly with the Twistail ecosystem.

Key differences that set Twistail apart include:
- Separation of style files for each component, improving organization and customization
- Use of [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev/) instead of Remix Icons (used by Tremor)
- Integration of Tailwind Variants for enhanced styling capabilities
- A carefully curated blend of design elements from both inspirational libraries

We're grateful to these projects for their contributions to the React and Tailwind ecosystem, and for providing the foundation upon which Twistail builds its unique identity.
