This page provides an overview of how to use Twistail with AI assistants and tools.
Twistail is designed to be AI-friendly, making it easy for AI tools and assistants to
understand and work with the component library. This page guides you through how to
leverage AI capabilities with Twistail UI.

## AI Reference Files

Twistail provides specialized documentation formats optimized for Large Language Models (LLMs) to better understand the component library structure and implementation details:

- [Overview Reference (`llms.txt`)](https://twistail.com/llms.txt) - A concise summary of all available documentation
- [Detailed Reference (`llms-full.txt`)](https://twistail.com/llms-full.txt) - Complete documentation in a clean and machine-readable format

### What is `llms.txt`?

The `llms.txt` standard is an emerging convention for presenting documentation in a simplified,
text-based format that's easy for LLMs to process. By following this standard, Twistail ensures
compatibility with AI tools and workflows, allowing seamless integration into LLM-powered
applications, research, or automation systems.

## Using Twistail with AI Assistants

When working with AI coding assistants like SourceGraph Cody, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT,
or other LLMs, you can reference these specialized documentation files to help the
AI better understand Twistail's components and patterns.

### Example Prompts

Here are some effective ways to prompt AI assistants when working with Twistail:

```markdown
"I'm using Twistail UI. Can you help me implement a form with Input, Select, and Button components?"

"Using Twistail UI, how would I create a responsive layout with Card components?"

"I need to implement a Dialog component from Twistail UI with custom styling. Can you show me how?"
```

### Component Implementation

When asking an AI to help implement Twistail components, you can direct it to the documentation:

```markdown
"Please refer to https://twistail.com/llms-full.txt for the Twistail UI documentation and help me implement a Dropdown Menu component."
```

## Benefits of AI-Friendly Documentation

- **Clean Format**: Documentation is provided in clean markdown without extraneous HTML or styling
- **Structured Content**: Information is organized in a logical, hierarchical manner
- **Complete API References**: All component props, variants, and examples are included
- **Implementation Details**: Code snippets show how to properly implement components
