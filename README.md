## Quick Start

TODO!

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages and apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `examples/react-vite`: Example application built with [Vite][vite] and [React][reactjs]
- `@repo/config-typescript`: Shared TypeScript configurations and [Storybook][storybook]
- `twistail-react`: Reusable React components and utilities

Each package and app is 100% [TypeScript][typescript].

### Publishing Packages

#### Run in dry-run mode

```sh
pnpm turbo publish:dry --filter=twistail-utils
```

#### Publish specific packages
```sh
pnpm --filter=twistail-utils publish
```

## Acknowledgements

Twistail is a thoughtful blend of design philosophies from two exceptional UI libraries, combining the best of both worlds:

- [Tremor](https://tremor.so/): Many of Twistail's foundational components draw heavy inspiration from Tremor's well-crafted designs. Twistail reimagines these components with its own architectural approach. Tremor is licensed under [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/tremorlabs/tremor/blob/main/LICENSE).

- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/): Twistail incorporates design patterns and component structures from these projects, adapting them to fit seamlessly with the Twistail ecosystem. shadcn/ui is licensed under [MIT](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

Key differences from Tremor and shadcn/ui include:
- Twistail separates style files for each component, improving organization and customization.
- Twistail uses [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev/) instead of Remix Icons which are used by Tremor.
- A carefully curated integration of design elements from Tremor and shadcn/ui.

We're grateful to these projects for their contributions to the React and Tailwind ecosystem, and for providing the foundation upon which Twistail builds its unique identity.
